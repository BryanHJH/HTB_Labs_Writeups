HTB challenge itself said that this was a windows machine and since it provided with credentials, it is most likely an AD environment.
Ran an nxc scan and checked what shares can be accessed, the user j.fleischman had WRITE access to the IT share.
Used smbclient to get into the IT share and downloaded the 'Upgrade Notice.pdf' file
In the PDF file, there were several CVEs that were mentioned. Looked through all of them and found two that seemed interesting: CVE-2025-24071 and CVE-2025-3445 
Initially, tried CVE-2025-3445 for its path traversal attack that may allow me to get the flags directly, but not sure where the user flag is and getting the administrator flag failed. 
So moved on to the CVE-2025-24071, found a few PoC's in GitHub, simply used one of them, created the exploit.zip and uploaded to the SMB IT share. Then started up Responder and captured p.agila's hash
Cracked p.agila's hash using hashcat and tried to check whether she has any other extra access to other shares but no. 
Used bloodhound-python to get data for bloodhound to ingest using the credentials I have. In bloodhound, from p.agila, she has GenericAll access to Service Accounts group in the domain and the Service Accounts group has GenericWrite to CA_SVC, which can help me to get tickets. 
So added p.agila into the Service Accounts group using bloodyAD, then used `certipy-ad` to perform a shadow credential attack on the ca_svc account.
Gotten the ccache file for ca_svc, ran `certipy-ad find` with the kerberos ticket (ccache file) and found that the domain is vulnerable to ESC16 attack. Followed the steps in `certipy-ad` wiki to perform the priv esc using ESC16 and got the administrator's hash. 
Evil-winrm using Administrator's hash and got the user and root flags.
