# Bean (Bean Entities Aren't Nodes)

Bean provides block entities so that you can have the flexibility of custom
block types that are fieldable, and you can manage the block content without
adding clutter to the main content space. (For simple uses, core provides the
ability to "hide path display" on a content type, which can then be added as
"Existing content" blocks in layouts -- but Bean provides a cleaner interface
for this).
